# LES MISERABLES - THE MISERABLE ONE

### Introduction: The Illusion of Choice
What does it mean to choose freely in a world of shadows? In our hyper-connected age, we swipe, like, and love, convinced we are the architects of our fates. Yet, beneath this confidence lies a haunting question: Are we truly free, or are we captives of unseen forces- the invisible hand of algorithms? Social media, dating apps, and the grind of modern work mold our desires, and give us an illusion of choice. We are being chained by the system, thethered to illusions.

### Materialism: Chasing Shadows
In our modern world, superficiality dominates our existence. This superficiality has only been amplified through the introduction of social media - a mirage of perfection. We humans have devolved into being mere products, clapsed in the chains of the constant need for validation. 

This recalls **Plato’s allegory of the cave**. In the cave, prisoners mistake shadows on the wall for reality. In today's world, we are the prisoners, captivated by the facade. Often and tragically mistaking them for genuine connections. This hollow pursuit of the next validation and high leaves us often restless and empty. Plato’s tale also hints at a deeper question: If our perceptions are shaped by these shadows, do we choose freely, or are we bound by illusions we mistake for truth?

In social dating, this question becomes even more glaring. WE are judged by polished photos and bios rather than character or depth. Algorithms dictate our lives. We feel like we're in control, but are we truly?

### The Anatomy Of Dating
Social dating starts with thousands of people, lined up in cards, waiting to be accepted or rejected. A message opens a door into another person's world. After the exchange of words, the individuals move past the surface of a profile and into the real world. Do not forget though, you are just one of the plenty choices that both parties have, specially curated by the algorithms. Our freedom and choice of free will might not be as free as it seems. And this is where the problem starts to rear its ugly head. 


### Endless Choices For The Top: The Burden
Social dating drown us in options. Hundreds of potential matches, infinite scrolls and chasing the high of a new potential match. The problem here is two-fold. For the top 10% and the bottom 90%. Let's explore the top 10% first and we'll explore the latter. The top 10% are spoiled for choice. The freedom of choice creates a problem. Too much choice can paralyze us. This is the **paradox of choice**, a modern echo of **Jean-Paul Sartre’s** existential burden. Sartre saw freedom as both a gift and a curse; with every option comes the weight of deciding, and the fear we’ve chosen wrong. We are always chasing the idea of the perfect person because social media has wired us to do so. 

In dating, this means swiping endlessly, thrilled and haunted by the idea, that someone better might be out there. Commitment becomes a dirty word when the next match might be “the one.” It’s like **Sisyphus**, forever pushing his boulder uphill—effort without end, desire without satisfaction. This creates a deeper problem. Trust and loyalty means nothing when every connection is a mere transaction. A society of restless seekers isn’t a society at all—it’s just a crowd. This libert is a trap, binding us to evermore dissatisfaction. A bad relationship will lead to an easy exit because choices are abundant. Will you attempt to find a compromise and to work things out, when there's an easier option? This negative cycle feeds on itself. 

For the bottom 90%, freedom is a cruel jest. Like a farmer, trying to grow a tree in the desert.

### Modern Work: Drained and Disconnected
Then there’s work. The hustle culture, the gig economy, the 60-hour weeks. We are treated as mere cogs in the economic machine. When work is merely a means to an end, it loses meaning, and we lose ourselves. You are not free when there is a need to proof yourself. Today, that alienation spills into everything. If work consumes us, do we have the free will to choose how we love? Are we free to seek bonds, settling for the shadow of a swipe?

### An Existential Reckoning
Zoom out, and it’s an existential crisis. **Existentialism** says we’re free to craft our own meaning, but warns against **bad faith**—living fake lives to fit an external mold. Social media screams “be this,” dating apps reduce us to mere products, work swallows our souls. It’s a recipe for losing ourselves, for becoming cogs in a soulless system. When a whole society buys into that, it’s not just individuals who fall—it’s the collective spirit. We humans, have forgotten what it is like to love, and be loved.

### A Way Forward

The first step is awareness: recognizing that the shadows on the cave wall are not reality. We can choose to step into the light. This means resisting the algorithms, embracing yourself and the individual, putting in the effort and creating deeper conversations. It means prioritizing real-world connections over digital ones, where love can’t be reduced to a profile.

In the end, love is not a product to consume but a practice to cultivate. A relationship is often messy, imperfect, and profoundly human. Dating should not just be about you, but the opposite party as well. By stepping away from the shadows, we can rediscover what it means to love—and be loved.
